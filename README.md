# CakeCompany
refactored the GetShipment() method in the ShipmentProvider class in order to make the class easier to read, maintain, modify  
and to be unit testable, applied design principles such as SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, KISS and used design patterns suitably. 
Has unit test, which covers the successful shipment by adding mock for any dependencies. 
Tried using the logger, implemented serilog.
For dependency used Autofac framework.
